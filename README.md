# EEC193AB-RoveCrest
RoveCrest project for the EEC193AB course and University Rover Challenge
Key features included:
      AR Tag Detection
      Obstacle Avoidance
      Autonomous driving & Goal Setting
      Emergency pit detection & action
      Remote communication

Tested each mechanism separately from each other to avoid complications
  Emergency Detection & Escape Mechanism
    Placed car onto box to prevent from moving - should trigger the event to try to escape this “emergency” - not moving when its supposed to
  Ar Tag Detection & Action
    Checked to see if 2 AR tags are able to be detected by the rover, and if it was visualized in its world (RVIZ)
    If the rover detected an AR Tag then it would respond by moving slowly towards it
  Goal Setting & Autonomous Driving 
    Unable to fully test car due to lack of space/ safe area to test autonomous driving
    Looked to see if car’s throttle and steering responded to setting a goal
